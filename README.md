# GUI-Mimic
A GUI fuzzing tool that works by recording the user and making scenarios out of it

To make it work, you first need a few Python modules. You can get them with the following commands :

pip install pynput
pip install python-snappy

Once this is done, you just have to run recorder.py using Python.
